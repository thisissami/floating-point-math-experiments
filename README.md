Git clone or download this repository, then run `node output.js` to see the output of different methods.

You'll need to have a newer version of node (v10 onwards I think, maybe 8) because I'm using some ES6, and install `mathjs`. (`npm i` will do the trick; it's in the package.json requirements).

**IMPORTANT:** f all you need is better floating point arithmetic, please look at the `big.js` library. (https://github.com/MikeMcl/big.js) - it'll be better than this. :)
